# ErlabRentalWebApp
A Web Application built using:
- .Net Core for REST API
- NoSQL database program MongoDB and MongoDBCompass
- VanillaJS for website functionality
- HTML and CSS for Front-End

This project was my contribution to 4-Week long Erlab Summer Internship Program.
Website carries multiple similarities to Netflix and other streaming services alike.
Database contains several movies and TV Series with their descriptions in JSON format, I've later exported the content of the file to a Document structured NoSQL database using MongoDB.
I've created a REST API to manage data within the website using 3 layered architecture with .Net Core. Several CRUD methods and services.
Front-end has been written using HTML and pure CSS, no additional frameworks were used.
Back-end has been written using VanillaJS and suitable for ES6 standards, no additional frameworks were used.
Additionally, a feature to navigate by using arrow keys were added. This way website was targeted to be compatible to smart TV's and devices alike.

You can inspect several screenshots of the website down below:
